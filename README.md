# MovieSearch

This application connects to the IMDB API and picks out 10 random movies containing whatever is searched in the input field.

This application was created to practice connecting to API's as well as solve an issue I have by narrowing down what movies to watch.

Instructions:

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Use the command line to cd into the MovieSearch folder.
3. Run `node app.js` in the terminal ( it should return that the movie app server has started )
4. Open your web browser to http://localhost:3000/ and begin searching!
